This set up have vagrant file which creates two VMs (registry-server which has one additional
disk and that is partitioned as two LVM partition. One is mounted for Docker and other for registry). Client VM just has docker and created to test registry-server.

In this we are using Docker-Compose to run registry container. 

Here we have assigned two IP address and are hardcoded. This is require sequential set up means first Registry-server VM is created and later client. Please refer provisioners to learn about set up.
Registry-server is TLS enabled and password protected. username / password - testuser/testpassword.

API call to test registry-server - curl -k -X GET https:registry-server:port/v2/_catalog
